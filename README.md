## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- jQuery
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This was a Challenge from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2022. I learned how to use jquery.

### Continued development

I want to get better at knowing what to use when writing code in JavaScript and jQuery. This challenge was particularly difficult. It required reverse-engineering and problem-solving.
